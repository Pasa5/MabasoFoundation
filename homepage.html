            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Mabaso Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the creation and enhancement of a conducive learning and teaching environment in disadvantaged schools. We started this initiative with a simple yet powerful idea - to provide a helping hand to underprivileged students. Witnessing the barriers they face due to a lack of basic necessities inspired us to create a bridge between those who want to make a difference and schools in need. <span>Empowering Education for All</span>.</p>
